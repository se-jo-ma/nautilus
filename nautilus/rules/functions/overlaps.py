"""Python-backed CLIPS external functions for Nautilus routing rules.

Both externals operate on space-separated string multislots because the
Fathom YAML template layer does not yet expose CLIPS ``multislot`` slots
(see project-fathom rule-assertions research.md, UQ-5). The router encodes
``list[str]`` fields as space-separated strings before fact assertion and
these helpers decompose them on the rule side.

Registration uses ``Engine.register_function`` (fathom-rules >= 0.2.0), which
binds a Python callable as a CLIPS external invokable from rule LHS or RHS.
