"""Escalation-pack YAML loader (design §3.4, FR-7).

Escalation packs are declarative lists of :class:`EscalationRule` loaded from
``nautilus/rules/escalation/*.yaml`` (the built-in default pack) plus any
operator-specified directories. Each YAML file is expected to contain a
top-level *list* of mappings; each mapping parses into one ``EscalationRule``.

The loader tolerates non-existent directories (returns ``[]`` for that dir) so
callers can pass a mix of present and absent paths without special-casing.
