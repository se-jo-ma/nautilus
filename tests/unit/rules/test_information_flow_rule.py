"""Unit tests for ``information-flow-violation`` (AC-4.3).

Defined in ``nautilus/rules/rules/handoff.yaml`` at salience 250, the rule
fires on a ``data_handoff`` fact when the declaring (source) agent's
clearance dominates the handoff classification but the receiving agent's
clearance does NOT — i.e. the handoff would exfiltrate data above the
receiver's authorized level.

Two cases exercised:

- positive fire — ``from_clearance=secret`` dominates ``classification=
  confidential`` but ``to_clearance=cui`` does not → one ``denial_record``
  with ``rule_name="information-flow-violation"``.
- negative control — both clearances dominate the classification → no
  denial emitted.

Engine construction mirrors the Phase-1 integration smoke test's load order
so the hierarchy registry is populated before rule build.
