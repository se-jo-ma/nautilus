"""Attestation-sink fault-injection harness (Task 3.17, NFR-16, design §7.6).

Drives 1 000 ``broker.arequest`` calls through a :class:`Broker` whose
:class:`HttpAttestationSink` is wired to an :class:`httpx.MockTransport`
that alternates between success and raise. The harness locks in the
audit-first invariant (AC-14.5 / NFR-16):

* (a) Every request returns a :class:`BrokerResponse` — zero broker
  failures leaked out of the hot path, even when the sink raises on
  roughly half the emits.
* (b) Exactly 1 000 audit JSONL lines are written — one per request,
  regardless of attestation-sink outcome (NFR-8 / AC-7.1).
* (c) A ``WARNING`` log fires for every failed emit. ``HttpAttestationSink``
  absorbs transport errors internally and logs once at WARN after retries
  are exhausted — with ``max_retries=0`` that is one WARN per failure.

The test runs against the session-scoped ``pg_container`` fixture +
``tests/fixtures/nautilus.yaml`` so the broker hot path traverses the
real intent analyser, Fathom router, Postgres + pgvector adapters, and
audit writer — the sink failure is the only injected fault.
