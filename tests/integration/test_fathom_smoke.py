"""Integration smoke test for the Nautilus Fathom rules tree (Task 1.12 SPIKE).

Purpose: prove that the YAML/raw-CLIPS tree under ``nautilus/rules/`` loads
into a ``fathom.Engine`` and that the two default rules
(``match-sources-by-data-type`` salience 100,
``deny-purpose-mismatch`` salience 200) fire end-to-end against realistic
fact inputs and populate the ``routing_decision`` / ``denial_record``
templates via the new ``then.asserts`` (fathom-rules 0.2.0) path.

The rules themselves are shipped as raw-CLIPS ``type: raw`` function entries
(not YAML rule files) because fathom-rules 0.2.0 YAML ``expression:`` does
not expose a way to emit ``(test (<external> ?a ?b))`` LHS conditional
elements — see nautilus/rules/functions/nautilus_routing_rules.yaml for
the escape-hatch rationale. The YAML files under ``nautilus/rules/rules/``
are doc-only stubs (``rules: []``).

Loading order (must not change — externals must be registered BEFORE
``load_functions`` or CLIPS ``build`` errors with EXPRNPSR3):

  1. templates
  2. modules
  3. register_overlaps + register_not_in_list
  4. functions (loads the raw-CLIPS defrule bodies)
  5. rules (loads the doc-only empty rulesets — no-op)
