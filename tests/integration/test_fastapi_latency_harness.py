"""FastAPI latency harness (Task 3.17, AC-12.6, design §7.5).

Drives 1 000 sequential ``POST /v1/request`` calls through the ASGI
application wired by :func:`nautilus.transport.fastapi_app.create_app`
against an in-process :class:`httpx.AsyncClient` (ASGITransport — no
network socket) and a real :class:`Broker` over the session-scoped
``pg_container`` fixture. The first 100 responses are discarded as
warm-up; the remaining 900 are measured end-to-end (framework
overhead) with the per-source ``AdapterResult.duration_ms`` subtracted
so the metric isolates FastAPI + Broker bookkeeping — NOT adapter
round-trips. P95 over that 900-sample window must stay under 200 ms
(AC-12.6).

The test is marked ``@pytest.mark.slow`` so the default CI invocation
can exclude it when the coverage gate is the priority; it IS kept under
``-m integration`` because AC-12.6 is an integration-level guarantee
(the adapter + session-store + audit sink are exercised per request).
